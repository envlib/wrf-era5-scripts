# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **Hub repo = `wrf-model-eval`.** This repo is one part of the WRF/WVT project. Claude's memory is keyed to the **launch directory**, so **start Claude in the hub (`~/git/wrf-repos/wrf-model-eval`) and edit this repo from there** to keep context continuous — launching here instead gives a separate, sparse memory. Cross-repo open work + context: **`wrf-model-eval/OPEN_WORK.md`** and the hub's Claude memory.

## Project Overview

Automated pipeline to run the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model using ERA5 reanalysis data or WRF output as boundary/initial conditions. Runs inside a Docker container with WRF 4.7.1-ARW and WPS 4.6.0 pre-installed. All configuration is driven by a single `parameters.toml` file (gitignored; see `parameters_example.toml`).

The pipeline supports three execution modes selected by TOML/env flags:

- **Unified per-chunk** (default for production): set `[restart].enable=true` (without `preprocess_only`). Each invocation runs its OWN preprocess + WRF for one chunk of duration `interval_days`. wrfbdy/wrffdda/wrfinput/wrflowinp/trmask are local-only — never round-trip through S3. Only wrfrst + namelists persist on S3. With `stop_after_upload=true` the container exits after one chunk (SLURM chained pattern); with `stop_after_upload=false` the container loops internally until sim_end (local-dev pattern).
- **Single-stage**: full pipeline end-to-end in one container. Fine for short runs that fit in one job; no restart support.
- **Preprocess-only**: runs steps through `real.exe`, then exits without invoking `wrf.exe`. Useful for testing the preprocessing chain in isolation; inputs are left in the local `run_path` for inspection.

Unified per-chunk is the standard workflow because per-chunk preprocess avoids the wrfbdy/wrffdda S3 round-trip that dominated wallclock in earlier split-pipeline designs. Each chunk is a single SLURM job that does preprocess + WRF; chunks chain via `--dependency=afterany` and auto-detect their position from the latest wrfrst on S3.

## Image Matrix

Three model variants × two compilers, plus the frozen WRF-4.3.3 reference. Each pipeline image is built from
a build-context dir here and `FROM` a `wrf-docker-builds` base. The pipeline derives WVT behaviour purely
from `parameters.toml` (`tracer_opt`/`[wvt]`) and is image-agnostic — pick the image by variant + compiler.

| Variant | Compiler | Pipeline image | Build context | Base (wrf-docker-builds) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| no-WVT | gfortran | `wrf-auto-runs:2.7` | `gfortran_wrf/` ✦ | `wrf-wps-debian:1.2` |
| no-WVT | Intel | `wrf-auto-runs-intel:1.3` | `intel_wrf/` | `wrf-wps-intel-ubuntu:1.0` |
| single-region WVT | gfortran | `wrf-auto-runs-wvt:1.8` | `gfortran_wvt/` | `wrf-wps-wvt-debian:1.3` |
| single-region WVT | Intel | `wrf-auto-runs-intel-wvt-sr:1.0` ✦ | `intel_wvt_sr/` ✦ | `wrf-wps-intel-wvt-sr-ubuntu:1.0` ✦ |
| **multi-region WVT** | gfortran | `wrf-auto-runs-wvt-mr:1.0` ✦ | `gfortran_wvt_mr/` ✦ | `wrf-wps-wvt-mr-debian:1.0` ✦ |
| **multi-region WVT** | Intel | **`wrf-auto-runs-intel-wvt:2.0`** | `intel_wvt/` | `wrf-wps-intel-wvt-ubuntu:2.0` |
| reference (WRF 4.3.3) | gfortran | `wrf-auto-runs-wvt-ref:1.2` | `gfortran_wvt_ref/` | `wrf-wps-wvt-ref-debian:1.0` |

✦ = **new scaffolding — build + validate on demand** (gfortran multi-region is the higher-risk
cross-compile; the MR overlay was developed/validated on Intel `ifx`). The legacy
`wrf-auto-runs-intel-wvt:1.14` is the Intel single-region image (superseded by `…-wvt-sr`); multi-region at
`num_wvt_regions=1` reproduces single-region bit-for-bit.

**Pick by `parameters.toml`:** `tracer_opt ≠ 4` → no-WVT; one `[wvt]` region → single-region (or MR at N=1);
multiple `[[wvt.regions]]` → multi-region. Compiler: Intel for throughput, gfortran for portability/backup.

Both WPS builds inject heap-array allocation flags (`-fno-stack-arrays` for gfortran, `-heap-arrays` for Intel) — required for stable long preprocessing runs (without them metgrid segfaults in libc partway through). See `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/wps_heap_arrays_requirement.md` and `wrf-docker-builds/CLAUDE.md`.

**WVT source-mask bbox** (`[wvt]` in `create_trmask.py`): two mutually-exclusive forms, each intersected with `mask_type` and evaluated per-domain — `bbox_deg = [min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon]` (degrees; `min_lon > max_lon` selects a dateline-spanning arc, OR semantics in XLONG's -180..180 frame, for NZ Lambert domains whose east edge passes 180) and `bbox_ij = [i_min, i_max, j_min, j_max]` (0-based inclusive grid indices, i=west-east / j=south-north — straight, equal-area-per-cell bands preferred for ocean-fetch sensitivity tests since a lon band tapers poleward). The old `min_lat/max_lat/min_lon/max_lon` scalar keys are removed and raise a migration error.

**Multi-region WVT** (image `:2.0`+): tag N disjoint source regions in ONE run (replaces N duplicate runs).
**Lateral-boundary face tags** (`[wvt] boundary_faces`, added 2026-09-06; spec:
`wrf-model-eval/docs/wvt_boundary_tags_design.md`). `boundary_faces = ["west", "east", "south", "north"]`
appends one **column-relabel** region per face after the source regions, so their region indices are always
last and the source indices never move. Absent or `[]` reproduces the pre-existing behaviour exactly, which
is how the 8-region fallback is selected — a one-line edit, not a config rewrite. Each face's mask is the
outermost `relax_width` cells nearest it (corner ties to west/east); the shells therefore sit exactly in the
margin every source mask already zeroes, so they are disjoint from the sources by construction. Fewer than
four faces is allowed (each face costs ≈0.4 node-days per simulated year) but leaves part of the margin
untagged, which `create_trmask` reports on stderr. `set_params` derives `num_wvt_bdy_regions`, requires
`tracer2dsource=1` (otherwise WRF never reads the mask file and every region silently sources nothing), and
**refuses a multi-domain run** — on a nest `spec_bdy_final` overwrites the relabelled cells.

**Enclosed-water fill** (`[wvt] fill_enclosed_water`, default `false`). Reclassifies water bodies with no
4-connected path to the open sea (lakes, tidal harbours) as land in `create_trmask`'s **own derived copy**
of the landmask — never the geogrid the physics reads. Off by default because it moves cells between
regions, so enabling it changes results relative to earlier runs. When it is off and enclosed water exists,
the tool says so on stderr.

Define an array of `[[wvt.regions]]` tables under `[wvt]` (order = WRF region index; each region sets its own
`mask_type`/`bbox_deg`/`bbox_ij`, inheriting a top-level `[wvt] mask_type` as default — e.g. a
`mask_type="land"`+NZ-bbox region for the land-ET case). `create_trmask.py` derives `num_wvt_regions` (1..12)
from the region count (validates it if the user also set it) and writes a region-dimensioned
`TRMASK(Time, wvt_regions, sn, we)` (always — even N=1, since the WRF registry field is `i{wvtreg}j`).
**Regions MUST be disjoint** (no cell in two masks — `create_trmask` errors on overlap): each region tags its
cells' surface ET, so an overlapped cell double-counts and the per-region fractions stop summing to 1;
disjoint regions sum EXACTLY to a single all-source run (the linearity the design relies on) — to combine
areas you ADD them, never subtract. Per-region outputs: 2D accumulators (`TR_RAINNC`/`TR_RAINC`/`PWAT_TR`/…)
carry a `wvt_regions` axis on one variable; 3D tracer fields use named members (`qv_tr`, `qv_tr_02`..`_0N`),
which `utils.resolve_output_variables` auto-expands when filtering `output_variables`.
`set_params.validate_wvt_regions` pre-flights the constraints (count≤8; for >1: `tracer_opt=4`,
`bl_pbl_physics=0`, `tracer3dsource=tracer3dsink=0`). A flat single-region `[wvt]` block still works (= N=1).
See `intel_wvt/parameters_example_wvt.toml`. **Cost:** the base atmosphere is integrated once and the
per-region tracers ride on top (wall-clock ≈ `T_base + N·T_tracer`), so adding regions costs a fraction of
a full run each — one N-region run ≪ N single-region runs. (Full note: `wrf-docker-builds` CLAUDE.md / the
`wrf-wps-intel-wvt` image readme.)
**Validated end-to-end (2026-06-26):** a full production-config 4-region Cyclone Gabrielle run (FDDA + CCI
SST + restart chunking) reproduces the **independent** `:1.14` single-region runs (identical lat/lon masks,
different WRF build) — zero NaN, per-region precip ratios 0.993/0.989 at r≈0.9999, exact conservation,
clean bucket + restart — so multi-region attribution is production-ready. Bundle + analysis:
`wrf-runs/projects/tests/wvt_multiregion_12km/analyze_bundle.py`.

**Image 1.12 adds native runtime column diagnostics** (`phys/module_diag_wvt_columns.F` in the WVT branch): 8 new 2D fields written at history-write time — `PWAT`, `PWAT_TR`, `SLP`, `VIMF_U`, `VIMF_V`, `VIMF_TR_U`, `VIMF_TR_V`, `IVT`. Formulas match cfdb-ingest's offline computation exactly (validated to ~1e-7 relative agreement), so the 3D source fields (`QVAPOR`, `qv_tr`, `U`, `V`) can be dropped from `output_variables` for ~30× wrfout storage reduction. The `mslp` and `pwat` lowercase names in older configs were cfdb-ingest-derived only and no longer needed — use the uppercase native names.

## Pipeline Execution Order (`wrf-auto-runs/main.py`)

### Unified per-chunk mode (default — `[restart].enable=true`, neither split flag set)

`main.py:run_chunked_pipeline(run_uuid)` drives a chunk loop. Each iteration:

1. `detect_remote_restart_state(run_uuid)` — `rclone lsf` against `inputs/<run_uuid>/`; finds the latest wrfrst timestamp on S3 (or None for chunk 1). Lightweight metadata read, no download.
2. `sim_start = user_start_date - begin_hours` (real WRF start). If `restart_state` is not None, `chunk_start = restart_state`; otherwise `chunk_start = sim_start`. If `chunk_start >= sim_end`, exit cleanly (simulation complete).
3. `chunk_end = min(chunk_start + interval_days, sim_end)`. Compute `remaining_begin_h = max(0, original_begin_hours - elapsed_h_since_sim_start)` so chunks falling inside the spin-up window get a properly reduced `history_begin_h_<n>`.
4. `params.set_chunk_dates(chunk_start, chunk_end, remaining_begin_h)` — mutates `params.file['time_control']` (start_date, end_date, history_file.begin_hours) so downstream `set_nml_params` calls read chunk-specific values. Also flips `params._chunked_mode_active=True` which gates `set_nml_params` from double-subtracting begin_hours from start_date (the chunked path supplies the real WRF chunk_start directly; single-stage / preprocess-only paths still pull start_date back by begin_hours).
5. Existing preprocess pipeline: `check_ndown_params` → `check_nml_params` → `set_nml_params` (twice, with `run_geogrid` between) → `create_trmask` (WVT only) → `dl_era5` / `dl_wrf` → `run_era5_to_int` / `run_wrf_to_int` → optional `process_sst_cci` → `run_metgrid` → `update_metgrid_levels` → `run_real`. `run_real` rmtrees `run_path`; we don't fight that — every iteration starts fresh.
6. If `restart_state is not None`: `download_wrfrst_to_run_path(run_uuid)` pulls the prior chunk's wrfrst from S3 into the freshly-recreated run_path.
7. `apply_restart_namelist(restart_state, restart_interval_minutes, end_date_override=chunk_end)` — always called (sets `restart_interval` and `write_hist_at_0h_rst=.true.` on chunk 1 too); on chunks 2+ also sets `restart=.true.` and `start_date*` = wrfrst timestamp, `override_restart_timers=.true.`. The `write_hist_at_0h_rst` flag forces wrf.exe to write a history frame at chunk_start so the next chunk's `Feb13_00_00_00.nc` clobbers any prior 1-frame version with a full 8-frame version. ⚠ That clobber requires both uploads to use the SAME filename, so the archive naming convention must never change mid-chain — see "Archived output filenames" below. With `stop_after_upload=true`, also overrides `end_date*` to `chunk_end` so wrf.exe exits naturally at the chunk boundary (no SIGTERM).
8. `upload_chunk_namelists(run_uuid)` — uploads ONLY namelist.input + namelist.wps to `inputs/<run_uuid>/` (debug archive). No wrf*input/bdy/fdda/lowinp/trmask uploads — those are local-only in this mode.
9. `monitor_wrf(...)` — runs `wrf.exe` via `mpirun -n {n_cores}`; polls every 60s for completed wrfout / wrfxtrm / wrfzlevels / wrfrst files and uploads them.
10. If `params.restart_stop_after_upload`: return (caller submits next chunk container). Else loop to step 1.

### Single-stage / preprocess-only

When `[restart].enable` is not set (or `preprocess_only=true`), the pipeline runs the full sequence below in a single container. `set_nml_params` pulls the namelist's `start_year/month/day/hour` back by `begin_hours` (so WRF integrates the spin-up) and sets `history_begin_h_<n>` to suppress wrfout for that leading span — the namelist's effective `start_date` is `user_start_date − begin_hours`, and the first wrfout frame lands at `user_start_date`.

1. `check_ndown_params()` — Determine if ndown is active and which mode (`"single"` or `"nested-run"`). Returns `(ndown_check, ndown_mode, nested_run_domains, domains_init)`.
2. `check_nml_params()` — Validate executables and domain configuration
3. `set_nml_params()` — First pass: configure namelists for the initial domain set
4. `run_geogrid()` — Execute `geogrid.exe`; returns domain bounding box
5. `set_nml_params(domains_init)` — Second pass: time/date/history params, output file list
6. `create_trmask()` — (WVT only, `tracer_opt=4`) Generate the region-dimensioned tracer mask file(s); multi-region via `[[wvt.regions]]` (see Image Matrix / WVT notes above)
7. `dl_ndown_input()` — (ndown only) Download prior wrfout files
8. `dl_era5()` or `dl_wrf()` — Download ERA5 NetCDF or prior wrfout via rclone
9. `run_era5_to_int()` / `run_wrf_to_int()` — Convert to WPS intermediate format
10. `process_sst_cci()` — (CCI SST source only) Process CCI SST to WPS Int
11. `run_metgrid()` — Execute `metgrid.exe` via `mpirun -n {n_cores_preprocess}`
12. `update_metgrid_levels()` — Auto-detect `num_metgrid_levels`, update namelist
13. `run_real()` — Execute `real.exe` via `mpirun -n {n_cores_preprocess}`. In nested-run ndown mode this produces `wrfinput_d0N` for every domain in `domains_init` (parent + ndown target + nested children) so the inner nests have real-derived ICs after the post-ndown promotion.
14. `run_ndown(mode=ndown_mode, post_n_domains=...)` — (ndown only) Execute `ndown.exe`. On success, post-promote step diverges by mode:
    - `"single"`: delete `*_d01`, rename ndown-produced `*_d02 → *_d01`. Subsequent `wrf.exe` runs a single domain.
    - `"nested-run"`: ascending-order shift — delete coarse-parent inputs (`wrfinput_d01`, `wrfbdy_d01`, `geo_em.d01.nc`), then `*_d02 → *_d01`, `*_d03 → *_d02`, ... (geo_em files included). Then `set_nml_params(nested_run_domains)` rebuilds `namelist.input` for the post-promote subtree.
15. (preprocess-only) Print "preprocessing complete; inputs left in run_path", then exit
16. `monitor_wrf(rename_dict=...)` — Launch `wrf.exe` via `mpirun`, poll for output, upload files in real-time. In nested-run ndown mode `rename_dict` maps every renumbered domain back to its user-space id (e.g., `{'_d01_': '_d02_', '_d02_': '_d03_'}`). `utils.rename_files` iterates files in descending order to prevent `os.rename` from silently overwriting siblings — multi-domain renames are the first caller to hit this; the latent collision bug was fixed at the same time as this feature.

## Mode Toggles (TOML / env vars)

All can be set in `parameters.toml` or overridden via env var (env wins):

- **`preprocess_only`** (default `false`) — Skip the WRF stage; run preprocess through `real.exe` and exit. Inputs left in local `run_path` for inspection.
- **`cleanup_inputs`** (default `true`) — When true: deletes intermediate preprocessing files (met_em, ERA5 NetCDF, WPS int files) locally during the run. When false: keeps everything for inspection / re-running.
- **`run_uuid`** (default: newly generated) — 13-char hex identifier for the run. Precedence: env > TOML > generated. Used as the S3 prefix for chunked-mode wrfrst handoff.

### ndown mode (single vs nested-run)

Activated when `[ndown.input].path` is set in TOML. `check_ndown_params` infers the mode from `[domains].run`:

- **Single** (`run = [N]`, `N != 1`): existing behaviour — ndown 1→N, then wrf.exe runs N standalone.
- **Nested-run** (`run = [N, M, ...]`): ndown 1→N, then wrf.exe runs N + the listed nested children in a single invocation with two-way nesting. Each subsequent domain's TOML `parent_id` must point at a domain earlier in the list (validated in `check_ndown_params`). Only available in the single-stage path today; the unified per-chunk path silently ignores `ndown_mode`/`nested_run_domains` (see comment in `run_chunked_pipeline`).

### `[restart]` section — chunked WRF runs

Enables the unified per-chunk mode and configures wrfrst checkpointing.

- **`enable`** (default `false`) — Master switch. When true (and `preprocess_only` is not set), `main.py` dispatches to `run_chunked_pipeline()`.
- **`interval_days`** (required when `enable=true`) — WRF `restart_interval` set to `interval_days * 24 * 60` minutes. Also defines the chunk window length.
- **`stop_after_upload`** (default `false`) — When true, each invocation processes one chunk and exits (achieved by overriding `end_date*` in the namelist to `chunk_end`, so wrf.exe reaches it naturally; no signal handling). Designed for SLURM chained jobs across `interval_days` boundaries. **Disables auto-cleanup of `inputs/<run_uuid>/`** — multiple invocations share the prefix; user manually purges after the simulation completes. When false, the chunk loop runs internally until sim_end (best for local docker-compose dev).

**Spin-up handling (`begin_hours > 0`):** the orchestrator submits chunks over the *extended* window `(user_start_date − begin_hours) → end_date`, not just the output window. So with `interval_days=7` and `begin_hours=672` (4-week spin-up), `NUM_CHUNKS = ceil((sim_window + spin_up) / interval_days)` — e.g. a 1-year run becomes 57 chunks instead of 53. Each chunk's container computes `remaining_begin_h = max(0, original_begin_hours − elapsed_since_real_sim_start)` from its auto-detected `chunk_start` and writes that into `history_begin_h_<n>`. Chunks fully inside the spin-up window write no wrfout (just the `write_hist_at_0h_rst` chunk-boundary frame); the first chunk straddling `user_start_date` produces the first real output. Captured at module-load: `params._original_begin_hours`. Side-effect of `set_chunk_dates`: `params._chunked_mode_active=True`, which `set_params.set_nml_params` reads to skip the single-stage `start_date.subtract(history_begin)` step (chunk_start already represents the real WRF start in chunked mode, so subtracting again would double-count).

**Image consolidation:** the same `wrf-auto-runs-intel-wvt` image (current: **2.0** multi-region WVT / **1.14** legacy single-region) runs both preprocess and WRF in unified mode — the intel WPS is built dmpar (option 10 in `wrf-wps-intel-wvt/Dockerfile`) so `metgrid.exe`/`real.exe` parallelize via `mpirun -n N`.

**Wrfrst round-trip:** every chunk iteration re-downloads wrfrst from S3 even in the in-container loop case (where the wrfrst is technically already local). This is intentional: `run_real` rmtrees `run_path`, and rather than stash/restore wrfrst across that operation, we let every iteration look like a fresh container start. Cost is one wrfrst-sized download per chunk (~500 MB–1 GB); trivial vs. the ~2.6 TB of wrffdda re-downloads this design eliminates.

**S3 layout for restart artifacts:** wrfrst files live in the `inputs/<run_uuid>/` prefix alongside wrfinput/wrfbdy. Only the latest wrfrst per domain is kept on S3 (older ones are deleted via `cleanup_prior_wrfrst` after each upload).

**Wrfrst upload timing:** the in-loop poll uploads a wrfrst file when (a) a newer wrfrst exists locally (definitely complete), OR (b) the file's mtime has been stable for ≥60 seconds (single-write completion detected). Without (b), a wrfrst with no successor would sit locally until the next `restart_interval` write — potentially hours of wallclock for slow-resolving simulations.

**Final wrfout file at midnight chunk_end:** `monitor_wrf` skips the post-loop upload of the chunk_end single-frame wrfout file when the chunk's effective end falls exactly on midnight (00:00:00). Such a file is a "deceptive partial day" — same filename pattern as a new day file but contains only the rollover frame. Either (a) the next chunk clobbers it with a full 8-frame version on restart (via `write_hist_at_0h_rst`), or (b) it's the final chunk and the rollover state is also captured in wrfrst. Mid-day end_dates produce non-deceptive final files (multiple frames of legitimate end-of-sim data) and are uploaded normally.

**Archived output filenames carry no colons.** `monitor_wrf` injects a `':' -> '_'` rule into `rename_dict` (the same map used for domain renumbering) before handing files to `rename_files`, so uploads land as `wrfout_d01_2023-01-02_00_00_00.nc`. WRF and WPS are unconfigured for this — files on disk mid-run and the `Times` values inside every file keep their colons. Three things are load-bearing:

- **The rule is injected once, at the point of consumption**, not at the four `rename_dict` construction sites (`main.py:223/330/346/351`). `rename_files` has no other caller, so one injection covers every path including future ones.
- **`rename_files` matches each rule against the ORIGINAL filename**, never the partially-rewritten one, and returns every input file whether or not a rule matched. The nested-ndown map chains (`{'_d01_': '_d02_', '_d02_': '_d03_'}`), so matching on a rewritten name lands two domains on one target and `os.rename` destroys one silently; and dropping unmatched files strands them after a failed upload, since they already carry renamed names on the retry. Both have regression tests in `tests/test_rename_files.py` — that file is the only coverage this function has, so don't refactor it without reading them.
- **`wrfrst` must never be renamed** — it has to round-trip into `run_path` under the name `wrf.exe` reconstructs. It cannot reach `rename_files` (which only receives `query_out_files` output, prefix-filtered to `wrfout_d`/`wrfxtrm_d`/`wrfzlevels_d`), but the colon rule *would* match its name if it ever did.

WRF's `nocolons` namelist option was evaluated and **rejected**: it rewrites every filename WRF constructs — including the `met_em` input `real.exe` opens (`real_em.F:440` → `module_io_domain.F:395`) — and silently disables the `NUM_METGRID_SOIL_LEVELS` check, which `input_wrf.F:667` gates on a date-string equality that can never hold once the option is on. Do not re-propose it.

### Other key TOML/env settings

- **`n_cores`** (default 8) — MPI ranks for `wrf.exe`.
- **`n_cores_preprocess`** (default 4) — MPI ranks for `real.exe` / `ndown.exe`. Requires the gfortran preprocess image (`wrf-auto-runs-wvt:1.6+`) which has dmpar WPS.
- **`n_cores_metgrid`** (default 4) — MPI ranks for `metgrid.exe` only, decoupled from `real.exe`/`ndown.exe`. Defaults to a fixed 4 regardless of `n_cores_preprocess`, so existing configs get stable metgrid without edits. metgrid is I/O-bound and scales poorly; running it at high rank counts (e.g. the chunked SLURM pattern forces `n_cores_preprocess=SLURM_NTASKS`) triggers an intermittent SIGSEGV that passes on a plain rerun (over-decomposition / ASLR-sensitive out-of-bounds, not memory pressure). Keep it low (4–8). Set in TOML or via the `n_cores_metgrid` env var (env wins).

## S3 Layout

Under `<remote.output.path>/`:

- `inputs/<run_uuid>/` — Preprocess outputs handed to the WRF stage: `namelist.input`, `namelist.wps`, `wrfinput_d*`, `wrfbdy_d*`, `wrffdda_d*` (FDDA only), `wrflowinp_d*` (some SST options only), `trmask_d*` (WVT only), `wrfrst_d*_<TIMESTAMP>` (restart only — only the latest per domain). Purged after successful WRF if `cleanup_inputs=true` AND NOT `restart_stop_after_upload`.
- `wrfout_d*` / `wrfxtrm_d*` / `wrfzlevels_d*` (directly under `<remote.output.path>/`, NO run_uuid prefix) — Main WRF output files. Uploaded by `monitor_wrf` during the run, deleted locally after upload. (Earlier docs incorrectly placed these under a `<run_uuid>/` subprefix; the actual code in `utils.ul_output_files` uploads to the root path.)
- `logs/<run_uuid>/rsl.*` — `rsl.error.*` / `rsl.out.*` from `real.exe` / `ndown.exe` / `wrf.exe` failures.

## Key Architecture

All Python modules live under `wrf-auto-runs/`.

- **`params.py`** — Central config loader. Reads `parameters.toml`, detects Docker vs local mode (`[no_docker]` section), supports env var overrides (`start_date`, `end_date`, `domains`, `n_cores`, `n_cores_preprocess`, `duration_hours`, `preprocess_only`, `cleanup_inputs`, `run_uuid`, `restart_enable`, `restart_interval_days`, `restart_stop_after_upload`). All other scripts import `params` for paths and settings.
- **`defaults.py`** — Default namelist values for WPS and WRF. Defines field classification sets (`GEOGRID_ARRAY_FIELDS`, `DOMAINS_PER_DOMAIN_FIELDS`, etc.) and pipeline key sets (`DOMAINS_PIPELINE_KEYS`, `TIME_CONTROL_PIPELINE_KEYS`) that distinguish pipeline-consumed keys from WRF passthrough keys.
- **`set_params.py`** — Namelist management. Reads/writes Fortran namelists (`namelist.wps`, `namelist.input`) using `f90nml`. Handles domain subsetting/renumbering, time parameter injection, output stream configuration, and computes `time_step = dx * 0.001 * 6`. Uses `apply_overrides()` to merge TOML sections into WRF namelist sections. Also exposes `apply_restart_namelist(restart_time, restart_interval_minutes, end_date_override=None)` — in-place edit of `namelist.input` for restart/chunk-aware runs.
- **`upload_namelists.py`** — Owns the unified per-chunk `inputs/<run_uuid>/` S3 prefix lifecycle: `upload_chunk_namelists` (per-chunk namelist archive), `detect_remote_restart_state` (chunk position from S3 wrfrst metadata), `download_wrfrst_to_run_path` (pull prior chunk's wrfrst). Also owns the wrfrst lifecycle helpers used by `monitor_wrf`: `upload_wrfrst`, `cleanup_prior_wrfrst`, `parse_wrfrst_timestamp`.
- **`utils.py`** — Shared utilities: rclone config creation, output file querying/renaming/uploading, variable filtering via `ncks`, domain projection recalculation (`pyproj`).
- **`monitor_wrf.py`** — Runs `wrf.exe` and polls every 60s for completed output files, uploads them via rclone, and deletes local copies. On failure, uploads `rsl.*` log files.

## Data Flow

- **ERA5 / wrfout input**: downloaded from S3 → converted to WPS intermediate format → consumed by metgrid → deleted (if `cleanup_inputs=true`).
- **Preprocess-stage outputs**: `wrfinput_d*` / `wrfbdy_d*` / `wrffdda_d*` / `wrflowinp_d*` / `trmask_d*` written by `real.exe` to `params.run_path`. Local-only in unified chunked mode; left in `run_path` for inspection in preprocess_only mode.
- **WRF-stage outputs**: `wrfout` (history), `wrfxtrm` (daily diagnostics), `wrfzlevels` (height-interpolated) → uploaded to `<run_uuid>/` during the run by `monitor_wrf` → deleted locally.

## TOML → WRF Namelist Mapping

- **`[domains]`** — Domain geometry (geogrid fields, `e_vert`, `p_top_requested`, `parent_time_step_ratio`). The `run` key selects which domain subset to execute. Any key not in `DOMAINS_PIPELINE_KEYS` passes through directly to WRF `&domains`.
- **`[time_control]`** — Simulation period and output config. **`start_date` is the desired output start** (= timestamp of the first wrfout frame), not the WRF integration start. The integration begins `[time_control.history_file].begin_hours` BEFORE `start_date`; that span is spin-up and produces no output. `duration_hours` is measured from `start_date` (i.e. covers only the output window, not the spin-up). Any key not in `TIME_CONTROL_PIPELINE_KEYS` passes through directly to WRF `&time_control`.
- **`[physics]`** / **`[dynamics]`** — Override defaults; all keys pass to their respective WRF namelist sections.
- **`[fdda]`**, **`[bdy_control]`**, **`[grib2]`**, **`[namelist_quilt]`**, **`[diags]`** — Direct WRF namelist sections. All keys pass through via `apply_overrides()`.

## Domain Subsetting

The pipeline can run any subset of domains defined in `[domains]` (e.g., `run = [3, 4]`). When a subset doesn't start at domain 1, `utils.recalc_geogrid()` recomputes the map projection center and grid parameters. Domains are renumbered sequentially (e.g., domain 3 becomes d01 internally, renamed back on output).

## ndown Mode

One-way nesting from a prior WRF run. Activated by the `[ndown]` section in `parameters.toml`. Requires a single non-domain-1 domain (e.g., `run = [3]`). Downloads prior wrfout files for the parent domain, runs real+ndown, then runs WRF on the child domain only.

## SLURM Orchestration

For production unified per-chunk runs, a per-project orchestrator script (`run_wrf_hetzner.sh` is the working pattern) is a plain bash script (not a SLURM job) that:

1. Resolves `RUN_UUID` (env > `parameters.toml` > generated).
2. Reads `start_date` / `end_date` / `interval_days` / `stop_after_upload` from `parameters.toml` via a small awk-based TOML reader (no python deps in the cluster's global env).
3. Computes `num_chunks = ceil((end - start) / interval_days) + 1` (the +1 hits the early-exit branch and no-ops).
4. Submits `num_chunks` chained `chunk.sl` jobs via `--dependency=afterany`. Each chunk auto-detects its position from S3 wrfrst state.

Shared bash helpers (`toml_get`, `gen_uuid`, `resolve_run_uuid`) live in a per-project `lib.sh` that the three project shell scripts (`run_local.sh`, `run_one_chunk.sh`, `run_wrf_<cluster>.sh`) all source. Copy `lib.sh` alongside when cloning a new project dir.

The legacy split-pipeline pattern (separate `preprocess.sl` + `wrf.sl` chained via `--dependency=afterok`) is still supported — see `slurm_scripts/readme.md` for cluster-specific variants.

**Apptainer gotcha:** with `--contain --writable-tmpfs`, the in-container `/tmp` defaults to a tiny tmpfs (~64 MB) which causes ERA5 downloads to silently truncate (rclone streams through `/tmp`). All SLURM scripts bind `${LOCAL_SCRATCH}/apptainer_tmp:/tmp` to a real disk path.

## Key Dependencies

- **Python**: `f90nml` (Fortran namelists), `pendulum` (dates), `era5_s3_dl` (ERA5 download CLI), `era5_to_int` (ERA5→WPS conversion CLI), `pyproj` (projections), `h5netcdf` (NetCDF reading), `sentry-sdk` (error tracking)
- **System**: `mpirun` (MPICH), `rclone` (data transfer), `ncks` (NetCDF variable filtering), `uv` (package management)

## Style

- Python >=3.11, line length 120, black formatting with `skip-string-normalization`
- All remote data transfer uses `rclone` with dynamically created config files (see `utils.create_rclone_config()`)
- `parameters.toml` contains credentials — never commit it (only `parameters_example.toml` is tracked)
